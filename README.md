# php-pbx
An Exchange for Rotary Dial Telephones in PHP

This project is in the planning stage. Portions of php-iot will be utilized in its development. (See https://github.com/diggydude/php-iot)

This will be for homebrew/DIY hardware built from off-the-shelf components, not for a commercial VoIP hardware system. If you would like to participate in this project, please e-mail James at jselkins (at) yahoo (dot) com.
