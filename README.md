An Exchange for Rotary Dial Telephones in PHP

The core functionality is ready for testing. See the documentation for a list of required hardware components and third-party software.

This software is for a homebrew/DIY analog telephone exchange built from off-the-shelf components, not for a commercial VoIP hardware system. If you would like to participate in this project, please e-mail James at therealdiggydude (at) gmail (dot) com.
