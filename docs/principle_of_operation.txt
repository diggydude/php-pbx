                                 Components

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Cache: Stores program state variables in RAM.

  PBX: Resolves station ordinal numbers (0-7) from their assigned four-digit
  extension numbers.

  Station: Maintains state information about a Subscriber Line Interface Card
  (SLIC) connected to a telephone set. The SLICs employed in our exchange are
  the Shenzhen Ring&Tone KS0835F, readily available on Ebay for around $8 US.

  Line Finder: Scans each of the eight station hooks round robin, and supplies
  a list of stations that are currently off the hook.

  Call Progress Tone Generator: Connects to a station when it goes off-hook,
  and supplies audible tones (dial tone, ringing, busy, reorder) to inform the
  caller of call progress. The tone generator IC employed in our PBX is the
  Clare M-991.

  Digit Receiver: Connects to the calling station, counts pulses from the
  station's rotary dial, and translates them to the four-digit extension number
  of the called station.

  Ringer: Connects to the called station and supplies signals that cause the
  telephone to ring.

  Switching Fabric: A pair of 8x8 matrix switches that connect a calling
  station's audio output to the called station's audio input, and vice versa.
  The switches employed in our PBX are the Zarlink MT8808.

  Main Script: Initializes the above components and coordinates their
  operations in an endless loop to implement the telephone exchange.

                                   Droids

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A Droid is composed of a microcontroller development board (MCU), the
  firmware running on the MCU, the custom hardware being controlled by the MCU,
  a serial connection between the MCU and the main computer, and a PHP class
  that encapsulates these items, providing an interface between the MCU and the
  main script. The MCU employed will typically be an Aurduino Nano.

  The Line Finder, Call Progress Tone Generator, Digit Receiver, Ringer, and
  Switching Fabric in our PBX are all Droids.
